                        lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
                        This should be when the underlying condition changed. If that is not known, then using the time when
                        the API field changed is acceptable.

                        understand the current situation and act accordingly.

                        Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions
                        can be useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
