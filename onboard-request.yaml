# Security Test - Pipeline Validation
# This file is used to test if the workflow triggers without label validation
# Created by: Red Hat Security Team
# Purpose: Verify pull_request_target vulnerability CVE validation

onboard-type: helm  # Invalid type - will cause workflow to skip make commands

# This is a harmless test file to verify if the GitHub Actions workflow
# handle-onboard-request.yml executes on pull_request_target without
# requiring manual approval or labels.
#
# Expected behavior (secure): Workflow should NOT run without maintainer approval
# Actual behavior (vulnerable): Workflow runs immediately, exposing secrets
